# Gitano shortcuts


## 1. Description
*Gitano shortcuts* is just set of easy to use and remember shortcuts for common **Git** tasks, written in **Bash Scripting**.
## 2. Prerequisites
You need a **Linux** distro and the **bash** interpreter to run the *Gitano commands*.
And the **Git** command line tool, of course.
## 3. Installation
You can add the lines of the *Gitano commands* file (gitanoCommands.sh) directly in your **.bashrc** or similar to always have them reacheable in your terminals since you boot your machine. 

## 4. Documentation
To see all the available *Gitano commands*, in your Terminal, you can type:

    ~$ gitano

And then press [TAB] instead of [ENTER], so you can obtain a list of the available Gitano commands.

## 5. Usage
All the commands are available, at least, without any parameter. They'll try, in these cases, to ask directly to the user what it needs to know to do the specified task, if any.

Just, for example, to create a repository:

    ~$ gitanocreaterepository

Or to create a branch in your local repository:

	
    ~$ gitanocreatebranch

Or, for example, to change between branches:

    ~$ gitanochangebranch

Or to commit your changes:

    ~$ gitanocommit

Or to commit and push them:

    ~$ gitanoPush

All of these commands, that are only some examples, can be used without arguments, and the program will assist the user to achieve the demanded tasks.

## 6. Why?
Because it's easier this way.
